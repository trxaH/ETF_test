either 2 or 4 options per question/scenario
If you have a broad audience and want to keep things simple, 2 options per question might be best. 
This could be useful if your quiz is just a preliminary filter and you're planning to offer more personalized advice later.

If you want to provide more tailored recommendations and have a wide range of funds, 4 options might be better. 
This approach allows you to distinguish between different risk tolerances, investment goals, and other preferences.
